Five Tables 

users => done
merchants => 
orders => 

order_items  
products  
 
First step 

Develope an api with PHP/Laravel 
- change the port => done
- name the the url path "least-ordered-products-per-day" done 
- in the API there is a "From" and "to" query params are timestamps 
  the "day" param represents the day concered. 

Remember the unordered products are supposed to be at the TOP of the least ordered.

**Seeding your database with a good amount of data will help you with testing.
** There is a other way besides the seeders method called tinker also for filling fake data using factory, tinker is from my opinon is alot faster and less time consuming than seeder

Second step 

Create a frontend for calling the API data 
- From "Date time picker"
- To "Date time picker"
- Day "Drop down list with the days names"
- Generate Report "Button" => to download a report as Excel file.
After selecting all the fields above, the data must be shown in the table 
- Product Name 
- Product Price 
- Times been ordered 
- Merchant Name

Extra step (Bonus): 
As too many requests were invoked on the database, you are asked to cache the results of the last report and not to generate a report unless new changes have occurred.
